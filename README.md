# FQL-ADI: Federated Quantum Learning, Analysis, Design, and Implementation
Welcome to the FQL-ADI repository, where we present code implementation for a QFL framework.
Implementation include both JAX and PennyLane, two of the leading libraries for quantum and differentiable programming.

## Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g., mobile devices or whole organizations) 
collaboratively train a model under the coordination of a central server (or service), 
while keeping the training data decentralized. 
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that combines FL 
with quantum computing to potentially enhance computational capabilities and model performance.
This repository provides a practical implementation of QFL, offering a comprehensive analysis, 
design, and implementation framework that researchers and enthusiasts can use to experiment with and advance this novel field.

## Features
- **JAX Implementation**: Leverage the power of JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU acceleration.
- **PennyLane Implementation**: Utilize PennyLane's quantum machine learning capabilities for seamless integration with quantum circuits.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+
- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) (Refer to their installation guide)
- [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) (Refer to their installation guide)
