# FQL-ADI: Quantum Federated Learning, Analysis, Design, and Implementation

Welcome to the FQL-ADI repository, where we delve into the cutting-edge intersection of quantum computing and federated learning. 
This repository contains the code implementation for a framework that integrates quantum computing algorithms within a federated learning setting. 
Our implementation is versatile, supporting both JAX and PennyLane, two of the leading libraries for quantum and differentiable programming.

## Introduction

Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g., mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under the coordination of a central server (or service), while keeping the training data decentralized. Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that combines FL with quantum computing to potentially enhance computational capabilities and model performance.

This repository provides a practical implementation of QFL, offering a comprehensive analysis, design, and implementation framework that researchers and enthusiasts can use to experiment with and advance this novel field.

## Features

- **JAX Implementation**: Leverage the power of JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU/TPU acceleration.
- **PennyLane Implementation**: Utilize PennyLane's quantum machine learning capabilities for seamless integration with quantum circuits.
- **Notebook Support**: Run and experiment with the code interactively in Jupyter notebooks.
- **Python Script Support**: Execute the code as standalone Python scripts for integration into larger projects or for more streamlined execution.

## Prerequisites
